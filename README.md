#genRandom.sh
This is a simple script to generate random integers between 0-9999 for testing programs. It can take 0, 1, or 3 command line arguments.
1) If no arguments are given, it will print 20 integers by default. 
2) If 1 argument is given, it will print the that amount of integers.
3) If 3 arguments are given, the first will represent the amount of integers the user desires be printed, the second will be the floor
   and the third will be the ceiling representing a range of values the user wishes the random numbers lie between.
